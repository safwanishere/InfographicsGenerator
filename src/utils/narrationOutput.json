All installation and maintenance must follow the ANSI/NECA 505-2010 standard for high mast, roadway, and area lighting.\nMost of the detailed requirements are referenced elsewhere: submittals follow Section 680, materials must meet Section 680.2, lighting standards and towers are covered in Section 920, and LED luminaires are in Section 927. Delivery, storage, handling, and basic construction setup all follow the General Provisions.",

            "narration_script": "This work involves blast cleaning Portland cement concrete surfaces and removing any blasting residue from roadway and shoulder surfaces. You’ll need appropriate blasting and cleaning equipment, along with traffic control devices that meet the Contract and MUTCD requirements.\nTo protect the environment and workers, control dust by enclosing the work area or by using water spray around the blast nozzles. Provide and use eye and hearing protection, and use respirators with the correct filters or forced-air hoods when working in dust-contaminated areas.",

            "narration_script": "Acceptable methods include dry or wet abrasive blasting using compressed air nozzles or centrifugal wheels, with the option to use recirculating systems that recover the abrasive. Choose any of these approaches to meet the specification.\nDuring blasting, keep compressed air free of oil and grease, promptly remove residue when working within 10 feet of live traffic, and control dust to the Engineer’s satisfaction—work must stop if it creates unsafe conditions. Finish the surface uniformly, leaving only tiny traces of old coating in pits—no more than one percent of each square yard—and match the Department’s standard photographs. All work is subject to inspection, and any defective areas must be re-blasted. Measurement is by area for structures and by linear mile for variable-height median barriers, with each face measured separately.",

Provide manufacturers’ catalogs, diagrams, performance curves, and charts—model numbers alone aren’t sufficient—and allow 60 days for review. Also submit transferable guarantees and instruction manuals for the Department’s future operation and maintenance, and furnish a written warranty as specified.",
